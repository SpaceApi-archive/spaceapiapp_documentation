        <h3>Warning!</h3>

        <p>
            Version 13 is still a draft. Unfortunately the draft hasn\'t been fully worked out yet when the Space API was presented at <a href="https://entropia.de/GPN13">#GPN</a>. There are still tasks to be done such as:
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>working out the specification</li>
                <li>adapting the validator</li>
                <li>adapting some hard-coded parts in the documentation</li>
                <li>making things consistent</li>
                <li>getting the daily revalidator bugfixed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                If you update your API now, you\'ll most likely need to update it again in some days.
            </strong>
